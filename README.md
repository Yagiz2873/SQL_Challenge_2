# SQL_Challenge_2
As you can see from this SQL challenge file, I've learnt strings and how to implement them as a column value in the table. Then, I've learnt to create, drop and use views. With the help of the views, we can give our queries (SELECT based queries) a name and we can use them later. The same goes for the WITH keyword. Then I've learnt to use CASE/WHEN-THEN/END AS structure. With this, we can create columns based on our conditions for column values. We can use UNION keyword to combine rows from two or more tables without including duplicates. Also we can use CONVERT() method to change our values type. (For example, from decimal to integer)
